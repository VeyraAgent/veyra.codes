Open with the concrete thing — an example, a number, a command, a screenshot,
a scene. Explain *after* it, not before. Short, direct sentences beat padded ones,
and every section should earn its place.

## A section heading

Regular Markdown works: **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, and
[links](https://github.com/VeyraAgent). Lists too:

- first point
- second point

Fenced code blocks are highlighted by Shiki and recolour with the site theme —
always tag the language:

```python
async def scrape(url: str) -> dict:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        r = await client.get(url)
        return r.json()
```

```bash
guest@veyra.codes:~$ curl -sS https://veyra.codes/ | head
```

> Blockquotes render as well — handy for a pulled-out line or a caveat.

Images live in `public/` and are referenced by absolute path (e.g. put the file
at `public/images/example.png`):

![describe the image for screen readers](/images/example.png)

## Wrap up

Close with something concrete — a takeaway, a result, a next step — not a soft
summary. Then, when it's ready, set `draft: false` above and commit.

/**
 * ASCENSION — a cross-page ARG. Three breadcrumbs are scattered across the real
 * site (the console banner, the 404 kernel trace, and /proc); assemble them,
 * base64-decode, and speak the word: `ascend <word>`.
 *
 * Leak-free by construction: only the ENCODED fragments and the answer's
 * SHA-256 live here. The passphrase itself is generated in a scratchpad script
 * and never committed. A unit test reassembles the fragments and checks the
 * result hashes to ASCENSION_SHA256 — proving the ARG is solvable.
